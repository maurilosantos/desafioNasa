We have some priorities, such as: 1. Water: It's crucial that our destination planet has water in some accessible form. 2. Oxygen: We need to have oxygen, or something that can be converted into oxygen. 3. Temperature: It's also important to evaluate how cold or hot the planet is; your species doesn't seem to adapt well to extremely harsh environments. 4. Magnetic field: It's important that the planet has some way to deflect solar rays, like a magnetic field. Let's begin the mission."
